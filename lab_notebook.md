Jack: 12-04-19 (1hr)

preprocessed data into format for sklearn.

Jack and Zach: 12-12-19 (1.5hrs)

used small subset of data to train KNN, RF and SVM models.

Jack and Zach: 12-14-19 (1.5hrs)

used pickle to save data from pre-processing

Jack and Zach: 12-17-19 (7hrs)

used small, but larger than before, subset of data to train KNN, RF and SVM models.
created slides for the presentation, including confusion matrices.

Zach: 12-20-19 (2hrs)

used feature_importances_ attribute of random forests in sklearn
to print the 30 most predictive featues (words) when that algorithm is run.
amusingly, some recognizable names like "allen", "jeff" and "ford" are among these!
